## Data-Cleaning-in-SQL
In this project I took housing data and transformed it in SQL Server to make it more usable for analysis. Performed following data cleaning:
1) Separated data and time
2) Populated property address data
3) Separated PropertyAddress into Address,city using SUBSTRING METHOD
4) Separated OwnerAddress into Address,city and state using PARSENAME METHOD
5) Removed Duplicates in Common table expression table(CTE) using ROW_NUM
